# WHMCS Checkout Finland Payment Gateway

## Summary

Payment Gateway modules allow you to integrate payment solutions with the WHMCS platform.

# Checkout Finland Payment Module for WHMCS

Accept credit card or bank payments with Checkout. The Checkout.fi extension for WHMCS is a payment gateway plugin that routes customer payments through Checkout, allowing the customer to select their preferred payment method.

With Checkout you don’t need contracts directly and separately with every bank – you get them all with one contract! This plugin works by redirecting the client to the gateway hosted page to choose payment method that they wants.

## Why Choose Checkout?

    Accept credit card and bank account payments through your site
    Avoid security concerns since payments are processed through Checkout
    Accept Visa®, MasterCard®, bank payments, and more
    
## Secure Payment Processing

During the WHMCS checkout, customer is then directed off-site to make their payment through Checkout’s secure servers, and then is redirected back to your site. This allows you to accept multiple forms of payment and with several banks all in one easy, secure checkout integration.

## Installtion Steps

    Download the modules directory or Git clone the modules directory to root directory of WHMCS installtion.
    Upload the module folder into <whmcs_root> directory, and it will be placed <whmcs_root>/modules/gateways/.
